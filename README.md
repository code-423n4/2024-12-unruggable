**Note re: risk level upgrades/downgrades**

Two important notes about judging phase risk adjustments: 
- High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded to Low-risk (QA)) will be ineligible for awards.
- Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.

As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

### External integrations (e.g., Uniswap) behavior in scope:

| Question                                                  | Answer |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Enabling/disabling fees (e.g. Blur disables/enables fees) | No |
| Pausability (e.g. Uniswap pool gets paused)               | Yes|
| Upgradeability (e.g. Uniswap gets upgraded)               | Yes |

# Additional context

### Please list all the other chains you plan on deploying to:


Iteratively over time, numerous. Verifiers for these chains will be covered in later audits.

For this audit, we are covering Arbitrum, Base, Linea, Optimism, and Scroll. There are no explicit deployments on these chains in the code scope but i've highlighted them given the nature of the codebase.

### Are there contracts that are required to comply with any EIPs?
- contracts/GatewayFetchTarget.sol - ERC-3668

## Areas of concern

1. Correctness of the verification path for each of the five in-scope chains.
2. Confirmation that the Virtual Machine OP codes result in expected outputs.
3. Confirmation that the non-existence of data is appropriately verified/handled.
4. Verification of the trustless-ness of the solution.

## All trusted roles of the protocol
1. Verifier contract owner can modify the Gateway URLs.

## Main invariants
1. Only correct proofs are accepted. Invalid or unproven inputs are rejected.
2. No control by any party can allow for modifications that negate other invariants.

## Running tests

Testing instructions can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways?tab=readme-ov-file#testing).

## Miscellaneous
Employees of Unruggable and employees' family members are ineligible to participate in this audit.

Code4rena's rules cannot be overridden by the contents of this README. In case of doubt, please check with C4 staff.
